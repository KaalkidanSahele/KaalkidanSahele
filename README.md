# 👋🏽 Hey there, I'm Kaalkidan Sahele — or just Kaal (like "Cal", short for Callum... but cooler 😎)

> My GitHub profile consists of quite a few sporadic moments of high intensity, which usually means I'm at a hackathon, making a workshop, or working on a self-project on a recent obsession.

🎓 I'm currently a **DPhil student at the University of Oxford**, diving deep into the world of:

- **Data science** & **visualisation**
- **LLMs**, **NLP**, and sometimes *N*ot *L*iterally *P*redictable behaviour
- **Graphs** (the node-and-edge kind, not the "your stats are down 20%" kind)
- **GNNs** & **computational complexity** — because who doesn’t love a good NP-complete problem?

I love innovative ideas that may or may not break things, playing guitar (badly but enthusiastically), bad puns (and good ones too, but especially the bad ones), and, of course - tech communities & organising spaces that welcome *everyone* :)

## ✨ Fun fact

- 🧠 Former **President of Durham University Computing Society**
- 🚀 Co-founder and first lead organiser of **Durham Women in Tech's diversity-focused hackathon**  
*(Yes, I love ambitious ideas — and making them happen)*

## 📫 Get in touch!

I love hearing about new projects, weird ideas, and ambitious collaborations.  
Whether you're building something cool, want a co-organiser, or just want to nerd out over data/ graphs — **feel free to connect!**
