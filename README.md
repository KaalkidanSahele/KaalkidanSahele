# 👋🏽 Hi folks!

I'm Kaalkidan Sahele — or just Kaal

🎓 I'm currently a DPhil student at the University of Oxford, diving deep into the world of GNNs, ranginging from methods of extension into the spatial-temporal domain to uncertainty-awareness/ how trustworthy they are (given the rise of the graph structured data being used for training tasks, this is an increadingly important question). 

I'm also involved in running and partaking in hackathons, as organisers and as mentors.   

## ✨ Fun fact

- 🧠 Former President of Durham University Computing Society (I actually just graduated from Durham in the summer of 2025!)
- 🚀 Co-founder and first lead organiser of Durham Women in Tech's diversity-focused hackathon  
*(Yes, I really love ambitious ideas — and making them happen)*

## 📫 Get in touch!

I love hearing about new projects, weird ideas, and ambitious collaborations.  
Whether you're building something cool, want a co-organiser, or just want to nerd out over data/ graphs — feel free to connect! :D
