# 👋🏽 Hey peeps! *

I'm Kaalkidan Sahele — or just Kaal (like "Cal", short for Callum... but cooler 😎)

🎓 I'm currently a DPhil student at the University of Oxford, diving deep into the world of:

- Data science & visualisation
- LLMs, NLP
- Graphs (the node-and-edge kind, not the "your stats are down 20%" kind)
- GNNs & computational complexity — because who doesn’t love a good NP-complete problem?

My GitHub profile consists of quite a few sporadic moments of high intensity, which usually means I'm at a hackathon, making a workshop, or working on a self-project on a recent obsession.

I love innovative ideas that may or may not break things, playing guitar (badly but enthusiastically), bad puns (and good ones too, but especially the bad ones), and, of course - tech communities & organising spaces that welcome *everyone* :)

## ✨ Fun fact

- 🧠 Former President of Durham University Computing Society (I actually just graduated from Durham in the summer of 2025!)
- 🚀 Co-founder and first lead organiser of Durham Women in Tech's diversity-focused hackathon  
*(Yes, I really love ambitious ideas — and making them happen)*

## 📫 Get in touch!

I love hearing about new projects, weird ideas, and ambitious collaborations.  
Whether you're building something cool, want a co-organiser, or just want to nerd out over data/ graphs — feel free to connect! :D
